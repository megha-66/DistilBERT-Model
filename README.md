## Problem Statement :- 
In this work, we are finetuning a DistilBERT model on a drilling logs dataset by ONGC. The goal is to automate the process of event extraction. The input variable is the "Service hour type", which is an attribute of "text data type". The output or the vaiable to be predicted is the "Cde" or Code value, which is an Alphanumeric data type.
